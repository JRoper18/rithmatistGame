# Rithmatist Game

This is a game based off of Brandon Sanderson's [The Rithmatist](http://brandonsanderson.com/books/the-rithmatist/the-rithmatist/).

Features Implemented: 
- Circle Bind Points
- Chalkling Animations and Basic AI

If you want to contribute, just submit a pull request. I'll probably approve it. 

If you have any animations or chalklings you would like to send to me, I'll take any file type and transform it myself.
Send all chalkling ideas/animations/assets to: jackroper18@gmail.com (me).
